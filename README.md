## About the Project

This **IoT Ocean Monitoring System** deploys low-cost, energy-autonomous sensor buoys to continuously monitor key oceanographic and weather parameters such as water temperature, salinity, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and wind speed. Designed for small-scale, university-funded research, each buoy acts as a self-contained IoT node with marine-grade sensors and solar-powered microcontrollers that wirelessly transmit real-time data to a central server. The collected data supports weather forecasting, and marine analysis through an open-source and scalable architecture.
